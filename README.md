# C - Binary trees

I learned about the specifics and benefits of this collaborative project.
And drawbacks of using trees as data structures. How to was something we learned.
Both how to navigate through trees and how to qualify them. I have been working on the project.
AVL, Max Binary Heap, Binary Search, and Binary Trees were implemented.
